The portfolio: Do NBA refs favour the home team?
---

At the beginning of the article, the author discussed the fact of home-court advantage and then brings his hypothesis about the refs favour the home team and gives them more chance to win. The first impression about the data and analysis is agree with the hypothesis. However, if we take a second look, the data is problematic and the analysis results are confusing. Actually, if we incorporate more data, extend the timeline and look in details of the figures, the evidence that the author provided is actually not  very convincing.
